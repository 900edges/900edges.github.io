    <h1 style = "text-align:center;"> About </h1>
    
    <p> I'm a 6th year PhD student in applied math at Columbia university. I currently work on with large-graph limits of 
      graph optimization problems, reaction--diffusion equations on graphs, and stochastic processes on graphs.
      My past work on variational inference relates to proving theoretical guarantees for mean-field variational inference,
      studying Wasserstein gradient flows, Fokker-Planck equations and their convergence properties. 
      <br>
      I'm applying to postdocs right now. I am primarily interested in network science, calculus of variations, stochastic processes, 
      and interacting particle systems. Please see my <a href="https://edithjinzhang.github.io/math.html">math page</a> for 
      more. 
      
     

      <br>
      In Spring 2025, I will teach a 4-credit Calculus II course at the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art.
