<p> I'm a 6th year PhD student in applied math at Columbia university. My research relates to large-graph limits of 
      graph optimization problems, reaction--diffusion equations on graphs, and stochastic processes on graphs.
      My past work on variational inference relates to proving theoretical guarantees for mean-field variational inference,
      studying Wasserstein gradient flows, Fokker-Planck equations and their convergence properties.

      I graduate in May 2025, and I am currently applying to postdoc positions. I am primarily interested in network science, calculus of variations, 
      stochastic processes, and interacting particle systems. Please see my <a href="https://edithjinzhang.github.io/math.html">math page</a>.
