    <p> I'm a 6th year PhD student in applied math at Columbia university working on PDEs on large-graph limits, 
      interacting particle systems, and nonlocal analysis. In particular, I'm working with graphon limits of 
      graph optimization problems and graph dynamics such as graph reaction-diffusion equations. 
      I'm interested in some applied graph theory problems, including opinion dynamics, disease dynamics, and image segmentation. 
      My work with variational inference relates to proving theoretical guarantees for mean-field variational inference,
      studying Wasserstein gradient flows, Fokker-Planck equations and their convergence properties. 
      I am a passionate teacher and I am seeking teaching opportunities.
