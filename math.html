    <h3> Research </h3> 
    
    <p>
      I'm working with the intersection of large-graph limits, variational calculus, and nonlocal analysis. 
      My current research involves graph Ginzburg-Landau theory and nonlocal perimeter. 
      This research has applications in graph cut problems, image segmentation and social network analysis, among other questions. 
      This research is in progress with <a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/~mason/">Mason Porter</a>, 
      <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/jamesmichaelscott/home">James Scott</a>, and

      I'm also working on providing theoretical guaranteees for variational inference, a popular statistical inference algorithm.
