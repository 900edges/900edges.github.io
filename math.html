    <h2> Research </h2> 
    
    <p>
      I'm working with the intersection of large-graph limits, variational calculus, and nonlocal analysis. 
      My current research involves graph Ginzburg-Landau theory and nonlocal perimeter. 
      This research has applications in graph cut problems, image segmentation and social network analysis, among other questions. 
      This research is in progress with <a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/~mason/">Mason Porter</a>, 
      <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/jamesmichaelscott/home">James Scott</a>, and 
      <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~qd2125/">Qiang Du</a>. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I'm also working on providing theoretical guaranteees for variational inference, a popular statistical inference algorithm. 
      This research is in progress with <a href="https://kw2934.github.io/">Kaizheng Wang</a>.

      <li> We express variational inference as an approximate Wasserstein gradient flow. </li>

    <ul>
      <li> Mode-connectivity is an interesting property that has been discovered in neural net loss functions, which are high-dimensional and nonconvex. 
      It has been related to a "no bad local minima" property that's been noticed in practice, and is related to overparametrization. 
      This workshop paper demonstrates and begins to explain the existence of mode-connectivity in the ELBO, which is the loss function of 
        variational inference.  </li>
