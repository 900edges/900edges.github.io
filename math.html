    <h2> Research </h2> 
    <p>
      I'm working with the intersection of large-graph limits, variational calculus, and nonlocal analysis. 
      My current research involves graph Ginzburg-Landau theory and nonlocal perimeter. 
      This research has applications in graph cut problems, image segmentation and social network analysis, among other questions. 
      This research is in progress with <a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/~mason/">Mason Porter</a>, 
      <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/jamesmichaelscott/home">James Scott</a>, and 
      <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~qd2125/">Qiang Du</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm also working on providing theoretical guaranteees for variational inference, a popular statistical inference algorithm.

    <ul>
      <li> Mode-connectivity is an interesting property that has been discovered in neural net loss functions, which are high-dimensional and nonconvex. 
      It has been related to a "no bad local minima" property that's been noticed in practice, and is related to overparametrization. 
      This workshop paper demonstrates and begins to explain the existence of mode-connectivity in the ELBO, which is the loss function of 
        variational inference.  </li>

    <h2>Seminar</h2>
    <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~nhw2114/am_seminar_fall23/" > Applied Math student reading seminar </a>
    <br>
    This semester (Spring 2024), the AM student seminar meets on Thursdays, 1-2pm in the APAM conference room. 
    My friends/colleagues Han Yong Wunrow and Nathan Soedjak and I started this seminar in spring 2023 to gather with our 
    fellow PhD students to present recent learnings and progress, practice giving talks and feedback on talks.
