<h5>
  a hike 
</h5>
<p>
a still narrow clearing  <br>
is soft underfoot <br>
tender, rich and wet <br>
i imagine the soft is <br>
filled to the brim <br>
with mycelium <br>
muttering underground <br>
while shaggy trees drop <br>
needles, whole limbs  <br>
to feed all; <br>
their roots crawling over, under  <br>
eating up fresh decay <br>
pooped out by the moon <br>
squeezed in then out by earthworms <br>
that wrangle the wet mush <br>
into new life <br>
</p>

<h5>
a poem for ethan
</h5>
<br>
<br>
<p>
i dreamt <br>
we went to prom <br>
but i had no dress <br>
and couldn’t find you <br>
in the crowd <br>
of cots <br>
so i went to sleep <br>
in a tshirt <br>
with my friend <br>
dorothy  <br>
</p>


<h5>
  ode to topanga
</h5>
    <br>
    <br>
<p>
starting is cranky <br>
legs feel all wrong <br>
hunched on the highway <br>
trucks scream along <br>
<br>
  <br>
the turnoff is quiet <br>
smooth, unassuming; <br>
brush unattended, <br>
lovebirds a’crooning <br>
<br>
  <br>
cool mountain mist <br>
now opens me out <br>
soft morning flower <br>
by asphalt, devout <br>
<br>
  <br>
she lays me out flat  <br>
crimpled and raw <br>
wide beige expanse <br>
studded with awe <br>
<br>
  <br>
at top o’ topanga <br>
time is awarp <br>
to turn back, reluctant <br>
is my only resort <br>
<br>
  <br>
trucks scream along <br>
but now i flow steady <br>
with head in the clouds, <br>
legs are now heady <br>

</p>


    <h5>
      first time on mandy fire trail
    </h5>
  
<p>
trail unravels <br>
wise <br>
wide <br>
just like my eyes <br>
<br>
  <br>
immersed in sky <br>
cresting the <br>
crust <br>
of earth, which  <br>
seemingly shimmers <br>
laid out under <br>
 <br>
  <br>
miles broad <br>
but i still touch her <br>
a rolling crunch <br>
of dusty rubber. <br>

    <h5>
      2 moods up/down topanga
    </h5>
    <p>
      gray mist of the morning <br>
      is pierced and opened up <br>
      by many rays <br>
      which flood mountain flanks  <br>
      with color <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      …
      <br>
      <br>
      
      gray again <br>
      the road twists down down  <br>
      furry green-brown cliffs lurch <br>
      above <br>
      suddenly i am <br>
      afraid <br>
      
    </p>


    <h5>
      long distance
    </h5>
    <p>
      let me kiss you through <br>
      the uncanny valleys of  <br>
      internet cable  <br>
      distending distorting our <br>
      kisses till nothing  <br>
      but a shift of pixels and  <br>
      crackle of sound bytes <br>
    </p>


    <h5> morning stunt </h5>
    <p>
      great clods <br>
      clots <br>
      stewn cross-sky <br>
      filter light in  <br>
      roving streams <br>
      
      curdled white-blue <br>
      i’m blinded <br>
      awash in  <br>
      molten dream. <br>
    </p>


    <h5> everyday </h5>
    <p>
      everyday a brick <br>
      is placed <br>
      tenderly and sure <br>
      an awesome project <br>
      underway <br>
      on a growing dais <br>
    </p>


    <h5> little cat mize</h5>
    <p>
      the little cat mize <br>
      is a buddhist  <br>
      scholar of the highest level: <br>
      inside the house she is anxious, <br>
      cranky for food; <br>
      but outside, <br>
      no matter frigid night <br>
      or musical spring day  <br>
      her spirit calms <br>
      to that of an ancient monk  <br>
      her gaze sharp, <br>
      her body overtaken  <br>
      by stillness: <br>
      the nervous energy of her indoor  <br>
      self dissolves <br>
      softens <br>
      so that you can pet her <br>
      unendingly,  <br>
      but even in her uneasy self <br>
      she is the monk <br>
      an ascetic: <br>
      indeed,  <br>
      she doesn't even <br>
      wear any clothes. <br>
    </p>
