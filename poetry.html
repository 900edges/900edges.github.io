<h1>
  a hike 
</h1>
<p>
a still narrow clearing
is soft underfoot
tender, rich and wet 
i imagine the soft is
filled to the brim 
with mycelium
muttering underground 
while shaggy trees drop
needles, whole limbs 
to feed all;
their roots crawling over, under 
eating up fresh decay 
pooped out by the moon 
squeezed in then out by earthworms
that wrangle the wet mush 
into new life

a poem for ethan
</p>
<br>
<p>
i dreamt
we went to prom
but i had no dress
and couldn’t find you
in the crowd
of cots
so i went to sleep
in a tshirt
with my friend 
dorothy 
</p>

  ode to topanga
</p>
<p>
starting is cranky
legs feel all wrong
hunched on the highway
trucks scream along

the turnoff is quiet
smooth, unassuming;
brush unattended,
lovebirds a’crooning

cool mountain mist
now opens me out
soft morning flower
by asphalt, devout

she lays me out flat 
crimpled and raw
wide beige expanse
studded with awe

at top o’ topanga
time is awarp
to turn back, reluctant
is my only resort 

trucks scream along
but now i flow steady
with head in the clouds,
legs are now heady
