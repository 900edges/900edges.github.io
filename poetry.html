<h5>
  a hike 
</h5>
<p>
a still narrow clearing  <br>
is soft underfoot <br>
tender, rich and wet <br>
i imagine the soft is <br>
filled to the brim <br>
with mycelium <br>
muttering underground <br>
while shaggy trees drop <br>
needles, whole limbs  <br>
to feed all; <br>
their roots crawling over, under  <br>
eating up fresh decay <br>
pooped out by the moon <br>
squeezed in then out by earthworms <br>
that wrangle the wet mush <br>
into new life <br>

<h5>
a poem for ethan
</h5>
<br>
<br>
<p>
i dreamt <br>
we went to prom <br>
but i had no dress <br>
and couldn’t find you <br>
in the crowd <br>
of cots <br>
so i went to sleep <br>
in a tshirt <br>
with my friend <br>
dorothy  <br>
</p>


<h5>
  ode to topanga
</h5>
    <br>
    <br>
<p>
starting is cranky <br>
legs feel all wrong <br>
hunched on the highway <br>
trucks scream along <br>
<br>
  <br>
the turnoff is quiet <br>
smooth, unassuming; <br>
brush unattended, <br>
lovebirds a’crooning <br>
<br>
  <br>
cool mountain mist <br>
now opens me out <br>
soft morning flower <br>
by asphalt, devout <br>
<br>
  <br>
she lays me out flat  <br>
crimpled and raw <br>
wide beige expanse <br>
studded with awe <br>
<br>
  <br>
at top o’ topanga <br>
time is awarp <br>
to turn back, reluctant <br>
is my only resort <br>
<br>
  <br>
trucks scream along <br>
but now i flow steady <br>
with head in the clouds, <br>
legs are now heady <br>
