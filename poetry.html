<h5>
	cicadas 7/2024
</h5>
<p>
never have i heard something  <br>
so lush, joyous, desperate <br>
as the cicada song <br>
that's shimmers superfluous <br>
raining hard from a million hidden sources <br>
(kkkraaakkkkkk) <br>
(cccriccc) <br>
they shout themselves weak by fall <br>
but for now it is nothing but persistent joy <br>
in recognition of their hour 
</p>


	  
<h5>
	spring murmerings 4/2024
</h5>
	  
<p>
Weeks ago a graybrown park <br>
silent but for rock and rubber <br>
heard a green whisper <br>
from across the water and <br>
stirrings deep under ground. <br>
tensely listening, <br>
though long hesitant, <br>
word spread and <br>
buds perked up at the sound. <br>
  </p>
	   

	  
<h5>
  a ride downtown 2/24
</h5>
<p>
  a slow-moving <br>
	silvery haze of a river <br>
	(where does the sky begin?) <br>
	unravels beside me <br>
	as house music topples and blits <br>
	in my ears.
</p>

    
<h5>
  the fall 
</h5>
	  
<p>
leaves of all colors flicker sky-down <br>
and scrattle cross the road as their mother <br>
trees shush overhead. <br> 
each first and last leap of braven zen <br>
leaves a hush in its stead. <br>
</p>
 <br>


    

<h5>
  vermont hike 8/23
</h5>
	
<p>
a still narrow clearing  <br>
is soft underfoot, <br>
tender, rich and wet; <br>
I imagine the soft is <br>
filled to the brim <br>
with mycelium <br>
muttering underground <br>
while shaggy trees drop <br>
needles, whole limbs  <br>
to feed all; <br>
their roots crawling over-under  <br>
eating up fresh decay <br>
pooped out by the moon <br>
squeezed in then out by earthworms <br>
that wrangle the wet mush <br>
into new life <br>
</p>
 <br>
	
    
<h5>
a dream
</h5>
<p>
i dreamt <br>
we went to prom <br>
but i had no dress <br>
and couldn’t find you <br>
in the crowd <br>
of cots <br>
so i went to sleep <br>
in a tshirt <br>
with my friend <br>
dorothy  <br>
</p>
 <br>


    

<h5>
  ode to topanga
</h5>
<p>
starting is cranky <br>
legs feel all wrong <br>
hunched on the highway <br>
trucks scream along <br>
<br>
the turnoff is quiet <br>
smooth, unassuming; <br>
brush unattended, <br>
lovebirds a’crooning <br>
<br>
cool mountain mist <br>
now opens me out <br>
soft morning flower <br>
by asphalt, devout <br>
<br>
she lays me out flat  <br>
crimpled and raw <br>
wide beige expanse <br>
studded with awe <br>
<br>
at top of topanga <br>
time is awarp <br>
to turn back, reluctant <br>
is my only resort <br>
<br>
trucks scream along <br>
but now i flow steady <br>
with head in the clouds, <br>
legs are now heady <br>

</p>

<h5>
      first time on mandy fire trail
</h5>
<p>
trail unravels <br>
wise <br>
wide <br>
just like my eyes <br>
<br>
immersed in sky <br>
cresting the <br>
crust <br>
of earth, which  <br>
seemingly shimmers <br>
laid out under <br>
 <br>
miles broad <br>
but i still touch her <br>
a rolling crunch <br>
of dusty rubber. <br>
</p>
     <br>


<h5>
  2 moods up/down topanga
</h5>
<p>
  gray mist of the morning <br>
  is pierced and opened up <br>
  by many rays <br>
  which flood mountain flanks  <br>
  with color <br>
  <br>
  …
  <br>
  <br>
  below the cloudline: <br>
  gray again <br>
  the road twists down down  <br>
  furry green-brown cliffs lurch <br>
  above <br>
  suddenly i am <br>
  afraid <br>
</p>


     <br>
    

<h5>
  long distance
</h5>
	  
<p>
  let me kiss you through <br>
  the uncanny valleys of  <br>
  internet cable  <br>
  distending distorting our <br>
  kisses till nothing  <br>
  but a shift of pixels and  <br>
  crackle of sound bytes <br>
</p>
 <br>

	 

<h5> morning stunt </h5>
<p>
  great clods <br>
  clots <br>
  stewn cross-sky <br>
  filter light in  <br>
  roving streams <br>
  
  curdled white-blue <br>
  i’m blinded <br>
  awash in  <br>
  molten dream. <br>
</p>
 <br>

    



    
<h5> little cat mize</h5>
<p>
  the little cat mize <br>
  is a buddhist  <br>
  scholar of the highest level: <br>
  inside the house she is anxious, <br>
  cranky for food; <br>
  but outside, <br>
  no matter frigid night <br>
  or musical spring day  <br>
  her spirit calms <br>
  to that of an ancient monk  <br>
  her gaze sharp, <br>
  her body overtaken  <br>
  by stillness: <br>
  the nervous energy of her indoor  <br>
  self dissolves <br>
  softens <br>
  so that you can pet her <br>
  unendingly,  <br>
  but even in her uneasy self <br>
  she is the monk <br>
  an ascetic: <br>
  indeed,  <br>
  she doesn't even <br>
  wear any clothes. <br>
